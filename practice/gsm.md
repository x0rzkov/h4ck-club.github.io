###### Mobile network overview
```
operator infrastructure –> wireless connection (air) (UM interface) –> mobile telephone

Definitions
IMSI
International Mobile Subscriber Identity (written in SIM card).
e.g. [250001234567890] (<3 country digits><2 operator digits><10 number digits>)
MSISDN (Mobile Subscriber Integrated Services Digital Number)
Telephone number corresponding to IMSI inside operator infrastructure.
e.g. [79161234567]
TMSI (Temporary Mobile Subscriber Identity)
Temporary telephone identificator. Set randomly for some territory (bigger then one base station).
Changes if mobile leave territory or after several hours.
e.g. [0x12ab34cd]
IMEI
International Mobile Equipment Identity - unique for each telephone.
Consist of 15 numbers. (IMEI can be seen by *#06#)


GSM network organization
GSM traffic unit are bursts. Each burst consists of 23 bytes.

GSM traffic contains a lot of service information, e.g.

sending insignificant bursts (they consists of 3 bytes of 0x2b and 20 bytes of padding)
sending LAPDm messages with information about neighbour base stations
sending paging - describes called user (TCH paging format calls for voice, SDCCH - sms or ussd)
GSM (2g) can use encryption. Encryption types are:

A5/0 - no encryption
A5/1 - most used, can be cracked
A5/2 - algorithm A5/1, but with specially reduced resistance
A5/3 - Kasumi - not really used in practice (exist some theoretical papers claiming that this encryption is not secure too)


GSM frequency bands
Frequency bands shifts a lot across countries, standards, operators.
Averge values:

2g (GSM)	900 MHz - 1800 MHz
3g (UMTS, HSPDA)	900 МГц - 2,1 GHz
4g (LTE)	2.5 - 2.7 GHz
Example of russian cellular frequency bands:


GSM tools
There is several available sets:

osmocomBB (everything is only about 2G) allow to listen network, clone device, etc. (interesting article: MITM Mobile (хабр) (with osmocombb))

supported osmocombb mobile phone (about 10$) (mobile with only specific shipset are supported (because only those chipsets are well-documented and therefore targeted by developers))
CP1202 cable
osmocomBB - can be build from github sources or can be used prebilt virtual machine (vmware image) - virtual machine with installed osmocomDB from phdays
wireshark
osmocombb usage examples:

pre-start (enables L1 emulation):

connect turned-off mobile phone
master branch: # ~/osmocom-bb-master/src/host/osmocon/osmocon -p /dev/ttyUSB0 -m c123xor -c ~/osmocom-bb-master/src/target/firmware/board/compal_e88/layer1.highram.bin - not very stable (because phone will jump through various transmission windows and loose data)
sylvain branch: # ~/osmocom-bb-sylvain/src/host/osmocon/osmocon -p /dev/ttyUSB0 -m c123xor -c ~/osmocom-bb-sylvain/src/target/firmware/board/compal_e88/layer1.highram.bin - more stable (does not jump through transmission windows)
wait until osmocom command will hang
turn on the phone (phone will start to load modified firmware)
traffic sniffing

# ~/osmocomm-bb-sylvain/src/host/layer23/src/misc/ccch-scan -a ARFCN -i 127.0.0.1 (ip-address where to send captured packets)
run wireshark
active intervention

insert ANY sim card into phone (or it will fail to register in network)
# ~/osmocom-bb-master/src/host/layer23/src/mobile/mobile -i 127.0.0.1 - this will start for us virtual phone
# telnet 127.0.0.1 4247 - virtual phone control interface

OsmocomBB> enable -> OsmocomBB# list
clone - this will clone TMSI you specifyed
(TMSI you requested can be sniffed from traffic, after sending to targeted phone number sms or making a phonecall) - just think about some trick
Enough to make your own base station:

SDR (Software Defined Radio)

RTL2832U (8$) - support only GSM900
HackRF, BladeRF, UmTRX, USRP - cost 300$ and more, many more
GNURadio - open-source software development toolkit that provides signal processing blocks to implement software radios.
gr-gsm - Gnuradio blocks and tools for receiving GSM transmissions.
Wireshark
Traffic jammers (can be used to downgrade network connections to 2g).
Can be cheap, pocket-sized and on batteries.



GSM network attacks
Listen user’s traffic

Just using osmocomBB you can listen plaintext traffic.

To find compliance between telephone number and TMSI user id you can send SMS on user telephone number.

Kraken - approach for cracking GSM A5/1 encryption

Kraken is based on rainbow tables (about 2 TB). Properly configured Kraken can find session key in about seconds (usually 4 bursts is enough)

GSM network has a lot of service messages, which structure is fixed (e.g. insignificant bursts), or LAPDm messages sent in plaintext (at the beginning of network connection) and encrypted afterwards.
This known packets can be xored with their encrypted ciphertext (corresponding encrypted burst can be shortly bruteforced) and after getting cryptographic gamma it can be used by Kraken to find session key.

MITM using fake base station

Capturing devices:

cell 1 > I have neighbours {2, 3, 4}
fake cell > I am cell 4 (signal more powerfull)
telephone > I will go to more powerfull cell 4 (to fake cell)
MITM allows to:

eavesdrop
modify traffic (e.g. sms)
send sms (e.g. to paid numbers), make phone call
social engineering (user will phone to bank, but hacker will answer and ask for secret questions)
get telephone imei and using http://imei.info lookup telephone description and search for exploits, etc.
get IMSI
SS7 attacks (if we know victim’s IMSI number)

TODO: This must be explored deeper

get victims location
break victims accessability
intercept incoming sms
manipulation with USSD queries
manipulation with VLR victims’s profile
interpect outgoing calls
redirecting calls
DDoS MSC
Cloning other user’s telephones

osmocomBB can be used (and kraken in case encryption is enabled)

Outgoing: Attacker can send sms, ussd, make calls, etc.
Incoming: Incoming calls will come to one of the telephone randomly.



GSM network protection
Users protection
User can install android application, which will notice if telephone is connected to fake base station.
Disadvantages:

Application works not for all OS versions and only for qualcom processors.
Notification usully comes after the connection to fake base station has been established.
User can disable GSM connection, using only 3g and 4g.
Disadvantage: user can loose cellular connection in some regions without 3g and 4g

Operator protection
frequently change TMSI
use hopping (between wireless channels)
randomization of insufficient bits in insufficient service messages
do not send equal LAPDm in plaintext at the beginning of connection and in ciphertext afterwards
